# movie-info-tmdb-php
An application which displays movie information using PHP. 

Project done as a part of CSE-5335 Web Data Management Course at UTA.

This project is the same as <a href="https://github.com/c-deshpande/movie-info-tmdb">This</a>, but this one has been implemented in PHP.

Demo of the project can be found <a href="https://movie-info-tmdb-php.herokuapp.com/">Here</a>.

The problem statement is as follows,

<p align="justify">You will develop the movie application described in Project #2 using PHP. First create a project4 directory inside your web server root directory. Your project is to write only one PHP program movies.php inside project4. You don't need to user JavaScript nor you need any Proxy. The initial page is a search form with a text area widget and a "Display Info" button. When you click the button to search, you get a page that contains the search form and a section with the search results. The search result is an itemized clickable list of movie titles along with their years of release. When you click on the title of one of the search results, you get a web page with the search form and information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), and the names of the top five cast members (i.e, actors who play in the movie).</p>
